Changelog:
----------

2011-01-05 v1.0.6

    - Made the availability of the subject line for checking the spelling
      optional. This way, template authors can choose to leave out the
      subject in their template. (This is something that I use myself to
      only allow editing the thread starter subject and to make the rest
      of the messages automatically use "Re: <original subject>".)

    - Improved the module template loading code and prepared it for the
      compatible language support that will be available for Phorum 5.3.

    - The HTML code for the "Check spelling" button is now generated
      from a template file.

2009-01-27 v1.0.5

    - Made the module use the javascript hook in 5.2 and using templates
      for that cause

2007-01-10 v1.0.4

    - Made the module compatible with both Phorum 5.1 and 5.2 (the current
      development tree).

    - Made the module work correctly inside an embedded or portable
      environment.

2006-05-18 v1.0.3

    - Minor fix for PHP installations where short tags (<? .. ?> instead
      of <?php .. ?>) are not allowed. The language files uses the 
      short tags format (credits to Thomas for finding this).

2006-01-18 v1.0.2

    - Made a crude localization system. Speller Pages does not support
      localization and it's pure html/javascript on the client side.
      So I can't use code to implement languages. Therefore, localization
      is done by copying and translating the Speller Pages distribution.
      See README for more information.

    - Included a Dutch translation of the spellchecker.

2006-01-17 v1.0.1

    - Upgraded spellerpages to version 0.5.1

2006-01-11 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
