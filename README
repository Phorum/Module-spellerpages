Module  : Speller Pages
Version : 1.0.6
Author  : Maurice Makaay

Spellchecking based on aspell and Speller Pages v0.5.1. This module will add
a "Check spelling" button to the editor, which users can use to have
their message spell checked.

For more information on Speller Pages, see http://spellerpages.sourceforge.net

This module requires Phorum 5.1.5-beta or later to work correctly.

Install:
--------

- Make sure you have GNU aspell installed on your system. Without
  aspell, the spelling checker will not work. For more info on this,
  see http://aspell.net/
  If you are hosting your website with a hosting provider, then you will
  have to contact them if you want to have aspell installed;

- Unpack the Speller Pages module archive;

- Move the directory "spellerpages" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Speller Pages".


Localization:
-------------

Speller Pages does not really support localization. If you need a localized
version of the spellchecker, copy the directory spellerpages/speller in 
this distribution to spellerpages/speller-<language name>. Then translate
all the strings you want and update the server-script file
spellerpages/speller-<language name>/server-scripts/spellchecker.php to
use the language that you want.

Copy templates/emerald/spellChecker.js.tpl to
templates/emerald/<language name>-spellChecker.js.tpl and update that file
to let the this.popUpUrl variable point to the speller-<language name>
directory from above (take a look at the Dutch translation for an example.)

As long as you use a <language name> that matches the name of your main
language, the module will automatically recognize the availability of a
translated version of the spellchecker and load that one instead of the
default English one.

You'll also have to add a file to the lang directory of the module to
translate the button which starts the spellchecker.


Instructions for upgrading Speller Pages (mostly for the package mainainer):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Download a new distribution from http://spellerpages.sourceforge.net

* Unpack the distribution and place the distribution files
  in the speller directory

* Move the old "spellerpages" directory aside

* Rename the new distribution directory to "spellerpages"

* Place a .htaccess file in the spellerpages directory with in there 
  "allow from all" (else the files in there can't not be read by the 
  webserver, because the mods directory contains a .htaccess which 
  denies access to all)

* Move spellerpages/speller/spellChecker.js to
  templates/emerald/spellChecker.js.tpl

  Set the following configuration options in that file:

  this.popUpUrl = '{URL->HTTP_PATH}' +
                  '/mods/spellerpages/spellerpages/speller' +
                  '/spellchecker.html';
  this.spellCheckScript = 'server-scripts/spellchecker.php';
  this.popUpProps = "menu=no,width=440,height=350,resizable=yes,status=yes";

* Edit spellerpages/speller/server-scripts/spellchecker.php and
  set the following config options:

  $spellercss = '../spellerStyle.css';
  $word_win_src = '../wordWindow.js';
  $lang = 'EN';
  $tempfiledir = "/tmp";

* This should be all. Now test the spell checker.
